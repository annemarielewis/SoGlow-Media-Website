        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At SoGlow Media Marketing LLC, founded by Sophie Catto—a lifelong Coloradan and Roaring Fork Valley resident—we aim to transform the social media landscape. Though we provide social media management and consulting, our mission extends beyond generating likes and views. Disheartened by the toxic, addictive content prevalent before (and particularly after) 2020, Sophie envisioned a company dedicated to creating authentic, useful, and positive content that inspires real community engagement. Our dream is to encourage people to step away from their screens and connect in the real world, returning social media to its place as a means of connection, not an end in itself. Today, these online environments are dominated by reactive, algorithm-driven content, fostering a culture of passive scrolling on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. SoGlow seeks to counter this trend with human-centered, meaningful production, management, and engagement.</p>
        <p>While the marketing potential of these platforms is undeniable, SoGlow's core mission transcends traditional marketing services. We believe that in an era of overwhelming data and advancing technology, individuals deserve meaningful, human-driven control over their socio-digital footprint. For small businesses, organizations, and nonprofits, staying abreast of rapid technological changes can feel like an endless challenge, compounded by the weight of considering the broader economic and societal implications. This is where we can be of help!</p>
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human Connection:</strong> We emphasize the importance of genuine human interaction in all digital engagements.</li>
            <li><strong>Empowerment through Education:</strong> We strive to enhance the social media and AI literacy of our clients, equipping them with the skills needed to navigate and leverage these tools effectively and ethically.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact & Community Focus:</strong> We are dedicated to supporting small businesses, organizations, and nonprofits that aim to connect their communities, address climate change, or improve access to education and technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Practices:</strong> We advocate for responsible and ethical use of social media, ensuring that content is authentic, aligns with best safety practices, and is beneficial to its audience and directors.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Growth:</strong> We help our clients grow their digital presence in a way that is sustainable and aligned with their core values.</li>
        </ul>
